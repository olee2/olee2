### Hi, my name is Ole

I'm a student of web development at Noroff –– currently learning the basics of design and front-end development. Also learning react and frameworks based on node.js to stay ahead of the study plan at Noroff.

Prevously done some courses and self-study in Python.

I use this profile to display my projects and learning how to use git.
